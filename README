Heya! This is Lifetime, an interpreted language that I'm working on. I included
a snippet of what the language should look like in the file snippet.lt; if you
do any changes, make sure this file is runnable by the interpreter. Lifetime
files end with the .lt extension.

One might be wondering where the name came from; the answer is extremely
simple: have you heard of the "niche" band Lemon Demon? Neil Cicierega? Does
that name sound familiar to you? If so, excellent; the name comes from the
first track on Spirit Phone, Lifetime Achievement Award, I wanted to name this
language H or H# but the extensions .h and .hs are taken by C headers and
Haskell respectively.

For more info on how to work with this language:
